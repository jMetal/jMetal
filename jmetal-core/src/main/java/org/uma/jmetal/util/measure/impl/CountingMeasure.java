/**
 * A {@link CountingMeasure} provides a simple way to evaluate a number of
 * occurrences. For instance, it can be used to count how many solutions have
 * been generated within an algorithm, how many evaluations have been computed,
 * how many rounds have been run, etc. If these occurrences are provided by some
 * {@link PushMeasure}s, you can use {@link #link(PushMeasure)} to register the
 * {@link CountingMeasure} to these {@link PushMeasure}s. Otherwise, use
 * {@link #increment()} when the {@link CountingMeasure} need to count one more
 * occurrence. In order to get the count, one can access it immediately through
 * {@link #get()} or when it is updated by registering a listener with
 * {@link #register(MeasureListener)}.
