/**
 * This measure allows to have a simple way to compute the time spent in doing
 * something. For instance, an algorithm can compute the time spent to run. In
 * such a case, the algorithm would call {@link #start()} at the beginning of
 * the running and {@link #stop()} at the end. Additional calls to these two
 * methods can also be made during the running to exclude specific parts from
 * the counting. At any time during (and after) the running, the {@link #get()}
 * method can be used to know how much time have been spent so far. If the
 * algorithm is rerun, it will restart and the additional time will sum up to
 * the time already spent before, but it can be avoided by resetting the measure
 * with {@link #reset()}.
